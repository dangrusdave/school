    <h1>Why I Wear My Hat In Class</h1>
    <p>You may wonder why I always wear a baseball cap in class. I am not going bald, and I really don’t like wearing a hat
        indoors. Yet I must wear a hat to help me cope with a medical condition I have.</p>
    <p>In October 2003, I went on a Disney Cruise and SCUBA dived in Cozumel. When I got back to the ship it felt like I had
        water in my right ear and I used some ear drying drops that did not remedy the sensation. Three days later, I arrived
        back at Port Canaveral and debarked. It still felt like I had water in my right ear along with the usual sensation
        of still being on the ship. This sensation usually ends after one day ashore. Two weeks later, I still felt like
        I was on the ship and still felt like I had water in my ear. </p>
    <p>After much testing, many procedures, and drug trials, it was determined I had Meniere’s Disease. This condition causes
        a fullness sensation in my right ear, temporary and erratic deafness in my right ear, tinnitus in both my ears, and
        nystagmus. Whenever I close my eyes or when I’m in a dark room, it feels like I am leaning 10-15 degrees to the right
        and slowly turning to the left. 80 percent of my right ear balance system is inoperative. I get vection whenever
        I drive more than 45 minutes. Also, this disease causes motion sickness and migraines when I am exposed to my triggers.</p>
    <p>One of my triggers is scrolling computer screens. Whenever a professor scrolls a computer screen, I can get motion sickness
        and if there is enough scrolling I will get a migraine. To avoid this trigger, I sit in the front of the class and
        wear a baseball cap that I can tilt forward and block the scrolling screen. Sitting in the front of the class also
        allows me to use the podium as a barrier and limits the likelihood that I will have other students scrolling their
        screens in front or beside me.</p>
    <p>Over the last 14 years I have learned what my triggers are and do my best to avoid them. Sometimes it is unavoidable,
        and I usually carry <strong>Antivert</strong> and <strong>Maxalt</strong> to treat the motion sickness and migraines. On days where it is raining hard
        and continuously I will often miss class to avoid driving with windshield wipers on, they also trigger nausea and
        migraines.</p>
    <p>I also carry a note from my doctor in each of my cars in case I get pulled over while driving. I don’t want to get arrested
        for failing a DUI test when I have not been drinking. My nystagmus could lead a police officer to believe I have
        been drinking and my compromised balance system would make it easy for me to fail any balance tests. The note explains
        this and though I haven’t had to use it, I hope it works.</p>

    <h3>What is vection?</h3>
    <p><em>Vection</em> is the sensation that you are moving while your body is still. For me, I feel like I am still moving forward
        after I stop driving. The longer I drive, the longer I have the sensation. Sometimes it takes hours for that sensation
        to end.</p>
