I have also used dBase 3 and myPHP to develop databases.

My strongest soft skills are leadership and collaboaration.  I have over thirty years of leadership experience as a Naval Officer and leadership roles I held at Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. I have colloborated on cross-functional and multi-corporation teams.  I have the ability to see the big picture and keep a team moving towards completing tasks on time and on or under budget.

After completing this program, I would like to gain at least a year of experience in front-end development followed by some experience in server side e-commerce.
