<h2>What experience do you have building websites?</h2>

In the past I have built basic websites with MS Publisher, Macromedia Dreamweaver, Notebook++, Eclipse, and Textwrangler software.  The topics for these sites have been either assigned in courses or were built to showcase my interests in flight and the Navy.

<h2>What software experience do you currently have?</h2>

I have extensive experieince with the MS Office Suite, I have also developed basic skills in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere.  I have used Textwrangler, Netbeans, Eclipse, Notepad ++, MS Publisher, Macromedia Dreamweaver, and MS Expression Web software to develop HTML5, PHP, and CSS3 code. I have also used dBase 3 and mySQL to develop databases.

<h2>What are some of your strongest soft skills?</h2> 

My strongest soft skills are leadership and collaboration.  I have over thirty years of leadership experience as a Naval Officer and leadership roles I held at Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. I have collaborated on cross-functional and multi-corporation teams.  I have the ability to see the big picture and keep a team moving towards completing tasks on time and on or under budget.

<h2>Where do you see yourself working after you complete your studies?</h2>

After completing this program, I would like to gain at least a year of experience in front-end development followed by some experience in server side e-commerce.  My ultimate goal is to become a photographer (focusing on aviation and nature). I would like to market and sell my images via an e-commerce site I develop and maintain.
