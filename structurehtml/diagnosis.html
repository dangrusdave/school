            <h3>Epley Maneuver</h3>
            The
            <em>Epley maneuver</em> or repositioning maneuver is a maneuver used to treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
            (BPPV) of the posterior or anterior canals. It works by allowing free floating particles from the affected semicircular
            canal to be relocated, using gravity, back into the utricle, where they can no longer stimulate the cupula, therefore
            relieving the patient of bothersome vertigo. It is often performed by a medical doctor, nurse practitioner, occupational
            therapist, audiologist, physical therapist, osteopath or chiropractor after confirmation of a diagnosis of BPPV
            using the Dix-Hallpike test and has a reported success rate of between 90â€“95%.This maneuver was developed by
            Dr. John Epley and first described in 1980.Physiotherapists, osteopaths and some chiropractors now use a version
            of the maneuver called the "modified" Epley that does not include vibrations of the mastoid process originally
            indicated by Epley, as they have since been shown not to improve the efficacy of the treatment.</aside>
